    <h2>About Me</h2>


    <p><blink>What's up guys! My name is Johan but you can call me Jay if you find my
      name hard to pronounce. I'm originally from the Dominican Republic but I've
      been living in New York City for the past five years! I will be attending Binghamton University
      (If any of you are also attending Binghamton feel free to hit me up!) Well, as for my interests,
      I really enjoy watching anime, playing basketball, and volleyball, as well as eating a lot!   </blink></p>
